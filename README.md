# Langraph by Atul Kumar Arya

MODULE 1 (Introduction):

 Lesson 1 (Motivation):
     I learned that using just one AI model is limited because it can't use tools or do complex tasks on its own. So, we use something called LangGraph to build a           step-by-step plan for the AI.
     The tricky part is, the more freedom and control you give to the AI, the more likely it is to make mistakes. LangGraph is cool because it lets me decide which          steps in the plan are fixed and which steps the AI can control. This way, I can give the AI some freedom but still keep the whole system reliable and under my          control.

 Lesson 2 (Langsmith studio):
